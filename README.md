## **Project** Hewsletter

**1. Brief Introduction:**

ChatGPT's knowledge is rooted in data and information available up until September 2021. While it serves as a potent tool for managing various text-related information, it cannot overlook the gap between 2021 and the present, during which a substantial amount of new information has emerged and proliferated. Fortunately, Metaphor can provide ChatGPT with real-time updates, thereby transforming it into a dynamic and up-to-date information resource, ensuring it remains current.

With access to the latest news, ChatGPT can efficiently summarize and extract essential information, significantly reducing the time required for information retrieval. This has led me to conceive the concept of "Hewsletter," a platform that leverages Metaphor to acquire the most recent news and generate newsletters tailored to the user's specific interests.

**2. How you Built it**

Given our tight deadline of 2-3 hours to complete this project while ensuring its quality for our resume, it is imperative that we leverage serverless services, libraries, and even open-source projects to efficiently meet our objectives within this constrained timeframe. Consequently, although I invested several hours in coding, a significant portion of my time was devoted to selecting the most suitable technologies to accomplish our goals.

Ultimately, my decision was to employ Firebase for implementing authorization and authentication functionalities. Simultaneously, I opted for Next.js to handle routing, and I drew upon open-source projects with which I have prior experience and am familiar with their codebase. Through these strategic choices, I was able to successfully construct a project of sufficient quality.
